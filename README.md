# AI---Two-player-board-game.


The game will take place on a 7x7 board. The input to the program will be a parametric turn limit and
a parametric number of pieces for each player. Initial position of the pieces should be either selected
randomly or it should be possible to enter the coordinate of each piece through an interface that you
will design.
On each turn current player makes a single move:Moving his piece to one of its four neighbours. Game
ends when one of the players has no valid move or the turn limit is reached.
The game will be played between AI and a user. In the beginning, your program will ask if the user will
be Player1 or 2. If user is Player1, the first move will be user’s. Otherwise computer will make the first
move.
At the start of the game the number of pieces that belongs to each player and the maximum number of
turns will be given by the user.
After board is initialized and at the end of each turn you need to print the coordinate system and the
squares occupied with pieces labeled by their player indicator.
Computer’s turn:
Computer will move its piece to an available square and print the new position as shown below.
“Computer moves the piece at g4 to g5”
User’s turn:
If it is user’s turn, user will type the desired move in same structure as the computer. First the
coordinate of the piece that will be moved and then the new coordinate of the piece.
